#React responsive tabs
#WORK IN PROGRESS...

###Responsive
`Show more` tab + ability to transform to accordion 

###Fast
We are using scroll events to do event-based element resize detection (thanks to Back Alley Coder(http://www.backalleycoder.com/) and his article about Cross-Browser, Event-based, Element Resize Detection(http://www.backalleycoder.com/2013/03/18/cross-browser-event-based-element-resize-detection/))

###Accessible
The component outputs HTML code that follows accessibility principles (aka WAI-ARIA(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAI-ARIA)) and uses ARIA attributes such as `role`, `aria-selected`, `aria-controls`, `aria-labeledby` etc.
